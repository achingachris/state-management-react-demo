Ensure you have install NodeJS version `12.22.0` and later.

NextJS runs on:

1. Windows OS
2. MacOS
3. Linux (most Linux Distributions support NextJS)


## Text Editors

Feel free to use a text editor of your choice.

I will be using Visual Studio Code, if you'd love to follow along with my code styles and layouts, I'd recommend using it (I also love it 😍).

Here is a list of a number of text editors I highly recommend:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
3. [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

>There are a lot of text editors you can use.
