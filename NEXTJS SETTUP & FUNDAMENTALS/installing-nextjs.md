## Setup

The recommended setup is by using `create-next-app` as it automatically installs everything you need and updated node modules.

To start we will run the `create-next-app` on CMD(windows) and terminal using `npx`, which is a Node Package Executor.

You can also run with `yarn`

On your terminal, run the following command. 

>Ensure you are in a proper directory

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest <name-of-project>
# or
yarn create next-app
```

## After Installation

Once the installation is done, the following files and directories are created:

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── pages
│   ├── api
│   │   └── hello.js
│   ├── _app.js
│   └── index.js
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── vercel.svg
├── README.md
└── styles
    ├── globals.css
    └── Home.module.css

```

### Running the NextJS App

To test if the installation was successful. Open your CMD/terminal in the current project directory.

Run the following line:

```
npm run dev
```

Output:

```

> dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
event - compiled client and server successfully in 2.7s (171 modules)
```
