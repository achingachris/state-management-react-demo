## Starting NextJS Project

On a new folder, open the terminal on the project root folder (should be blank), and execute `npx create-next-app .` to create a NextJS project.

To test the installation, we will run the project. From the terminal:

```shell
npm run dev
```
![](/api/collection/4514957061783552/4997079427973120/page/6155300658216960/image/5225663899893760?page_type=collection_lesson)

```shell
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

A local server is started and we can view our site from port 3000:

http://localhost:3000
