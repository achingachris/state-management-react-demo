## Development Tools

### Text Editor:

I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Feel free to use any, but if you'd like to follow along, that's the best way to go.

### Operating System

All projects will be running on NodeJS, which is cross-platform. I am using Ubuntu as my operating system (time of creation), but the commands used are usable across Windows and Mac.

### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you are up to the path, I'd recommend you use the same version of Node (not much bigger difference than other versions):

[Installing NodeJS on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04#installing-using-nvm)

[Installing Node on Windows/MacOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Source Code

All the source code of the project will be available for reference on Github and also on all respective topics as code snippets.

I called the project `jamblog`, and the GitHub repository: https://github.com/achingachris/jamblog-client - Frontend(NextJS)

https://github.com/achingachris/jamblog-server - Backend (strapi)

You can follow along with each topic as a commit.
