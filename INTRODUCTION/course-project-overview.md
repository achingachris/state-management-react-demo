## Why a Course Project?

The best way to learn is by doing, especially when it comes to programming.

As we go through building on Jamstack technologies, we will be practicing what is preached here(LOL).

We will build a blogging platform using NextJS and Strapi CMS.

We will be dealing with the following features:

1. Blog lists
2. Search Blogs
3. User Accounts

We will go through all the basics of CRUD operations using an API as we build the project.
