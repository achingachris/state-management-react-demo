>"Jamstack" was originally cased as "JAMstack" where "JAM" stood for JavaScript, API & Markup.

Jamstack stands for Javascript, API, and Markup. This basically means creating applications using the three tools/languages: Javascript, Markdown, and API.

The architecture used makes applications run faster on the browser and makes them secure. In addition to all that, it is easy to build and scale applications in less time.

### JavaScript
There are no restrictions on which JavaScript framework or libraries you may use.

### APIs
Server-side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third-party services or your custom function.

### Markup
Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

## Why Use Jamstack

It is easy to build and maintain without compromising web quality, speed and security.

Jamstack is also relatively cheap to set up and maintain.

It has a better developer experience as it allows a Front-end developer to focus on designs rather than complex system architectures.
